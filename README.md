<!-- the only requirement is that you build a react application which loads data with an axios call

Phase 0
    setup install sequelize, pg, and express and nodemon as a dev dependency
    add a server.js file
    add a start:dev script which has nodemon call server.js

Phase 1
    add a backend data model and seed some data

Phase 2
    add express and a GET api route which will be used to on the front end to return your data
    /api/your_model_name_pluralized_goes_here (ie things, people, pets, etc.. etc.)

Phase 3
    add a GET / route to return index.html

Phase 4
    setup a React application which will load the data from your backend route by making an axios call. Look up the cdn for axios and add it as script tag which loads it. You only need one class component for this.
Phase n+ (extra credit)
    separate out your sever side code
        you can have a separate file for your data layer (sequelize code)
        you can have a separate file for your /api routes (you only have one so far)
    add ability to delete data
    add the ability to insert data -->
